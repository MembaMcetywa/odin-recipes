    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I was tired of boring, tasteless Salisbury steak recipes, so I created this one myself. Use good ground sirloin,<br>and it'll tastes wonderful and you won't have any grease to drain from the patties once they've browned. <br>Serve over mashed potatoes, egg noodles, or rice. Simply delightful! </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Patties</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground sirloin </li>
        <li>½ cup panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons milk </li>
        <li>½ (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper </li>
    </ul>   
    <h4>Gravy</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter </li>
        <li>2 cups fresh mushrooms, sliced </li>
        <li>1 sweet onion, sliced </li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour </li>
        <li>½ (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix </li>
        <li>1 ½ cups beef stock </li>
        <li>1 cup water </li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix ground sirloin, panko bread crumbs, egg, milk, and 1/2 packet onion soup mix, Worcestershire sauce, and black pepper together in a large bowl; shape into 5 patties.</li>
        <li>Heat a skillet over medium heat. Cook patties in hot skillet until browned, 3 to 5 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a separate skillet over medium-high heat.<br>Saute mushrooms and onion in melted butter until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir flour and remaining dry onion soup mix into the mushroom mixture;<br>cook and stir until flour is integrated fully, about 1 minute.<br>Stream beef stock and water over the mushroom mixture while stirring continually; bring to a simmer, reduce heat to medium, and cook, stirring frequently, until the liquid thickens, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Lie the browned steaks into the gravy; simmer until steaks are firm and gray in the center, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
